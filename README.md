# Projects


The first project I called Hello World is just an animated CSS background using font awesome icons that move across that background screen. One of my first projects when doing front end. 

The second project web-tempalte is a tempalte for a website. It uses a hover effect and centralized navigation along with an animated background image that changes in size. This was my second 
attempt at a project when doing front -end and it is really great.

The third project is a python script I worked on after being inspired by a mentor who was helping with front-end. I eventually went down a rabbit hole and found a great YouTube channel by John Rooney
and teh result was a full fledged pyhton webscraper for stock data.
