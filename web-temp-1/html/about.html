        <p>   My name is Chris. 
              The best time of my life has been right now. Being out of work and taking care of my two kids has only furthered my desire to become a better more experienced human being.
              My interest in coding really took off when I created a family vacation app using Appsheets in 2018. 
              It used API's to grab local weather information and it used google maps data to do in app searches for things like local breakfast spots and cafes etc. 
              The low code experience was great, but I really wanted to challenge myself to build something from ground up. So, I started looking into coding and got hooked.
         
         <p>  Now, I am a current student of Code The Dream and on my way to becoming a junior software developer. 
              I am excited to use these new skills in a way that will inspire others around me. 
              My life motto is : “If  I can learn to do it, then so can you”. </p>
